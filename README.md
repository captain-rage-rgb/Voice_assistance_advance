# Real-Time Voice Computer Agent

A real-time, streaming, interruptible voice-controlled computer agent inspired by a Jarvis-style desktop assistant.

## Core Differentiator

**The system is designed to execute recognized intents incrementally while the user is still speaking, rather than waiting for the complete utterance.**

Instead of recording a complete turn, stopping, running speech-to-text, querying an LLM, and only then acting, this architecture continuously listens to streaming audio, receives partial transcripts, recognizes complete sub-intents as they emerge, and begins executing deterministic computer actions in real time.

## Planned Capabilities (Future Phases)

* **Streaming Speech Recognition & VAD:** Continuous microphone audio capture with streaming partial and final transcripts.
* **Incremental Intent Detection:** Early intent resolution on partial transcripts to dispatch actions while speech is ongoing.
* **LLM Reasoning & Tool Calling:** Structured tool generation separating reasoning (*what to do*) from execution (*how to do it*).
* **Deterministic Computer Control:** Application management, browser automation (Playwright), window management, file operations, keyboard, and mouse automation on Windows.
* **Action Queue & Execution Engine:** Priority queueing, ordering, concurrency, and error handling.
* **First-Class Interruption & Cancellation:** Fast reaction to cancellation phrases ("Stop", "Cancel", "Wait", "Actually, open Firefox instead") to abort running and pending actions.
* **State Management & Safety:** Full awareness of active application, execution state, pending actions, with safety validation checks before running critical operations.

> **Note:** These are planned capabilities for upcoming phases and are **not** implemented in Phase 1.

## Current Status

**Phase 3 — Microphone and Audio Pipeline (Complete)**

The streaming audio capture and voice activity detection pipeline is implemented:
* **Audio Chunk Model (`app/audio/chunk.py`)**: Immutable `AudioChunk` representation capturing raw 16-bit linear PCM with metadata (sample rate, channels, duration, sample count, and timestamp).
* **Microphone Capture Abstraction (`app/audio/capture.py`)**: Non-blocking continuous audio capture using `sounddevice` (PortAudio). Forwards audio callbacks thread-safely into an `asyncio.Queue`.
* **Voice Activity Detection & Endpointing (`app/audio/vad.py`)**: Lightweight, robust VAD powered by `webrtcvad`. Configurable aggressiveness, speech onset threshold, and endpointing silence frames (distinguishing short breath pauses from utterance completion).
* **Audio Pipeline Coordinator (`app/audio/pipeline.py`)**: Asynchronous coordinator managing bounded chunk queuing, VAD consumer loop, graceful shutdown, and publishing `AUDIO_STREAM_STARTED`, `AUDIO_STREAM_STOPPED`, `VOICE_ACTIVITY_STARTED`, `VOICE_ACTIVITY_STOPPED`, and `AUDIO_ERROR` events.
* **State & Event Integration**: State manager tracks `microphone_active`, `voice_activity_active`, and `audio_error`.
* **Live Audio Demonstration (`app/audio/demo.py`)**: Runnable CLI script demonstrating live microphone streaming, voice activity detection, and clean shutdown.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10+ (tested on Python 3.12 on Windows)

### 1. Set Up Virtual Environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```powershell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` (optional for defaults):

```powershell
copy .env.example .env
```

### 4. Run the Application

```powershell
python main.py
```

### 5. Run the Test Suite

```powershell
pytest
```
